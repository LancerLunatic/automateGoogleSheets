# automateGoogleSheets
Python script 
This script uses the openai Python module to paraphrase each paragraph using the ChatGPT API, and the google-auth, google-api-python-client, and google.oauth2 Python modules to interact with the Google Docs API.
When you run the script, it will create a new Google Docs document with the paraphrased content, including page numbers and the original page numbers. The script assumes that the Google Docs document is publicly accessible and you have the appropriate API credentials to access it.
